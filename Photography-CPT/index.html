        <h2>Topic</h2>
            <p>My topic is <strong>Light Painting/Photography</strong>. I took photos in the dark or darker environments with my flashlight to show light movement with long shutter speeds. I took photos in dark areas and used different light sources and movement patterns to create a figure using that light (like christmas light, phone flashlight or plastic bag filled with light). I chose this because I think that this is something unique and difficult to produce, for a challenge.</p>

            <p class="genre">His genre is mostly photography, and playing around with light concepts. This photo’s camera angle is eye level/worm’s eye. I think I will play around with the worm's eye view, but most of my photos will be eye level. This scene is hard lit on the portal, and all the light comes from that portal. This photo demonstrates a wide angle view and motion blur. This photo will be my main struggle to try to recreate, at least the main idea should be done. It gives me a visual of what I can do with light and the layering off multiple photos. I hope to copy this type of shot in 1 of my photos.

        <p>This was taken during the Dr.Strange photoshoot and I also just found this one to be interesting, and could maybe look like some fire.

        <p>I made this photo with a 3 second shutter speed, while I moved the car with my hand (so it didn't go too fast) to make a paint stroke. I like how the white light dances in the red.

        <p>This photo is also the Ferrari in the other photos. This was a shorter shutter speed of 1”6 seconds, with a mid ISO and high f-stop. As you can see, it was highly edited and modified.

        <p>For this photo, I individually shot each letter with 4-6 second shutter speeds, then I added them together on one page. After that I applied a different filter to each letter. The E and O are also christmas lights shaped as that letter.

        <img class="CPTphotos" src="./Edited Photos/The Thinker.jpg" alt="">
        <p>This photo was a long shutter speed shot (5 seconds) coupled with a high ISO, and high f-stop. The subject is Shawn and Saniya took the photo. I was spinning Christmas lights in the background for that effect.
            <div>My photoshop edits were -</div>

        <p>This was another photo of Shawn while I was spinning the lights in the background (Saniya took the photo). It’s similar to the other one before it. The shutter speed was 4 seconds, High ISO and high f-stop. I like how the lighting turned out around his face and hands.

        <p>Since I had so much time on my hands I told myself I would do one more photo and chose this one to edit. I found a new tool called the patch tool where you select an area to be edited and select a part of the original image to duplicate that in the selected area (in this case the corners).

        <img class="CPTphotos" src="./Edited Photos/Blue Smoke.jpg" alt="">
        <p>This photo was at the start of the photoshoot. I had Ke’jae sit on a chair like the other photos, and instead of making a circle, I swung the lights back and forth in front of me to a 3 second shutter speed.
            <div>My photoshop edits were -</div>
            <ul>
                <li>Selected Ke’Jae’s body then applied x2 Blue Mood filter to the background.</li>

        <p class="og-edit">Original</p>
        <img class="CPTphotos" src="./Original Photos/Car Lightning 2 Original.jpeg" alt="">
        <p class="og-edit" id="edited">Edited</p>
        <img class="CPTphotos" src="./Edited Photos/Car Lightning 2.jpg" alt="">
        <p>At the start, I didn't realize how many car photos I would use, or any at all, but most of them like this one turned out great. The shutter speed was rather short at 2 seconds, and this time it was my sister who controlled the car for me so I could hold the camera from an eye level, but while moving.
            <div>My photoshop edits were (alot) -</div>
            <ul>
                <li>Generative expand on the left side</li>
                <li>Crop tool on the bottom and right side</li>
                <li>From that crop, generative expand on the bottom</li>
                <li>This time, I manually changed the contrast in the adjustments tab (+20 Contrast)</li>
                <li>More changes in the adjustment tab to the (RGB) blue levels (-0.5 blue)</li>
            </ul>

         <h3>"Tennis Lightning"</h3>

        <img class="CPTphotos" src="./Edited Photos/Tennis Lightning.png" alt="">
        <p>This photo is actually a tennis racquet on the right side, and I kept it still to show it on the picture, then I moved it across the screen to create a light paint. My shutter speed was 10 seconds, for 5 seconds the tennis racquet was still, and 5 seconds for moving it.
            <div>My photoshop edits were -</div>
            <ul>
                <li>Generative fill for the top and bottom lightning</li>
                <li>Contrast +20, Brightness + 10</li>
                <li>Color Curves - + 20 black, +4 white</li>
                <li>Blue Mood filter</li>
                <li>Crop Tool for the bottom corners</li>

        <img class="CPTphotos" src="./Edited Photos/Red lightning tennis.png" alt="">
        <p> This was a difficult initial photoshoot. What I had to do was place the racket on something stirdy and high up (so it was clear and still for the 15 second shutter speed) and click shoot, wait 10 seconds, then create a light streak across the screen. The background was actually my TV and a black yoga mat for the bottom. This again shows how editing is KEY for these types of photos.
            <div>My photoshop edits were -</div>
            <ul>

        <p> This was the same photoshoot as the photo before this, I was just trying out different ideas and when I used my iPhone flashlight, the made a cool effect on the TV, and I could use it as a light painting. So with a 3 second shutter speed I just made a streak on the TV, and with it, nice lighting on the tennis racket (The white thing is an LED light). This photo is more of a realisic and subtle edit.

        <p> This was my original planned out portal photo. I used a plastic bag with 2 flashlights inside of it and spun it in a circle. Then later, I took a photo of a trail with snow, and then our studio area. I made a frame tool area within the portal, smudged the edges of the circle to blend in, cropped that full thing into my studio photo, and clean that up. It didn't turn out as well as I thought, but near expectation.

        <h2 class="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>
        <h3 class="final">Did this project meet your expectations?</h3>
        <p>This project was something that I knew at the start that I would have to be creative about. The final results <i>surpassed my expectations</i> because what I had planned on the proposal was only half, or a third of what I actually ended up doing. I had originally planned to just draw with my phone flashlight, and create a portal, but over time I just found better ways of using light painting. I also got a lot of help with photographing and with subjects (thanks for that). </p>
        <br>
        <h3 class="final">What is the most succesful part of this project?</h3>
        <p>The most <i>successful part of my project</i> would have to be the color depth in my photos. Because I used a lot of contrast in my photos, it brings out the color, which makes the photos pop. So the editing part is the most successful part of this process. The least succesful part would probably be the proposal because it did not match what I ended up doing (like with the car).</p>
        <br>
        <h3 class="final">What would you change if you had to redo this project?</h3>
        <p>If I were to <i>redo this project</i>, I would have started with higher expectations and vision for what photos I was to shoot. I would also take more time to plan out photoshoot and plan. That means that my proposal would be more accurate and I would have shot my photos in quicker time because I would know exactly what to shoot and how, instead of figuring it out midway. An example of this could be when I was trying to shoot my tennis photo, and I had to no idea how to do it and it took a while to just to even start (because I never proposed it nor planned it fully). </p>
        <br>
        <h3 class="final">What are 2 skills you've improved on during this course?</h3>
        <p>The two skills i've improved on since the beginning of this course would have to be my photoshop skills and my ability to use manual mode. The more experience I had with photoshop the more I figured out the tools, like the adjustments tab or the spot healing brush tool. My skills using manual mode mostly improved during the end of the course while playing around with the ISO for the exposure assignement, or the shutter speed for this CPT. For photography, I found that practice made improvement. </p>
